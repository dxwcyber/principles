    %h2 Good security happens in small chunks

  .text
    %p Good security comes from constant, iterative effort.
    %p Make small changes that address the problems you need to solve, starting with the most urgent and important work, and learning as you go.
    %p Good approaches make small changes and observe their effects, because itâ€™s rarely clear what the consequences of a given change will be.
